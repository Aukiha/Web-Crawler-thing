# Web-Crawler-thing
A simple Jsoup test program that was made to test out searching and retrieving certain html elements on webpages. For this example, the program searches for certain articles of clothing from one of three websites: Uniqlo.com, Oldnavy.ca, and thebay.com. It then returns information about the clothing, such as its price, color and product number.
